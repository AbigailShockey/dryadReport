```
render_report.R species number_of_sequences snp_distance_matrix core_genome_tree

  species                 name of species analyzed
  number_of_sequences     number of sequences analyzed
  snp_distance_matrix     SNP distances generated by SNP calling pipeline
  core_genome_tree        core-genome phylogenetic tree created by core-genome pipeline
```
